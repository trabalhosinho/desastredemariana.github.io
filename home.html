  <h2> How does the Mariana's City disaster affects you, that does not live in the directly affected cities?</h2>
<p> If you live in Grande Vitória or Grande Belo Horizonte and you think you have not been affected by the Rio Doce disaster,
you are mistaken. The river may not even pass through your city, but much of what you consume comes from cities close to it. 
  
  </p>
  <br> 
  <p>In Colatina, farmers continue to use the water from the river for irrigation; and
although most of the plantations do not survive, what remains is marketed to the state of Espírito Santo. Most farmers do not even know that
water is contaminated, and those who know it use it the same way by lack of alternative. And that same water that is used for agriculture is what people drink.
 </p>
  <br>
  <p>
Os aquíferos também foram contaminados pelos metais pesados contidos na "lama" (em níveis muito acima do permitido pelo governo brasileiro), 
e a água retirada dele é usada para consumo e agricultura em outros lugares mais distantes, como o sul de Minas Gerais.

  <p> Now mud, debris and metals begin to dry through the cities and the dust begins to affect people directly. The blocks of dry mud were used to repaving
streets, and trucks that pass up dust. People are completely uninformed and the government has not taken any major steps toward the disaster. </p>
  <br>
  <p> 
The metal will not leave the river by itself nor disappearing naturally, and while nobody does anything to change the situation people are becoming contaminated
and will suffer greatly in the long run. One of the biggest disasters in Brazil occurred only one year and a half ago but almost no one talks about it. It's not like we could pretend
That nothing happened and expect it to be arranged.
