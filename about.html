 <h2> What was the Mariana's city/Rio Doce disaster? </h2>
  <p> On November 5, 2015, a tailings dam from Samarco (owned by Vale and Anglo-Australian BHP) broke and caused a flood of mud, waste, heavy  and radioactive metals
 that followed by the Rio Doce and devastated several cities of Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
The workers at the dam site said they felt a "jolt", something like a small earthquake; but they continued working since they did not notice major problems.

    Several cities were shaken by the incident, directly and indirectly; And the consequences are still visible, although little publicized by the media.
From the loss of homes to lives, what people have lost is irrecompensable. Nevertheless, the company Samarco has agreed to indemnify
the impaired families.
  </p>
  <p>However, the government has taken the focus of this criminal disaster and treats the matter as closed. No more talk about this, and people still
do not know that they can still be harmed. Contaminated water being consumed and used in agriculture, metals becoming
spread everywhere. When will it reach you?<p>
