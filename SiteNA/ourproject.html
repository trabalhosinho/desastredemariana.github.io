<h2>Nosso Projeto:</h2>
  <br>
<p>We are students of the IFES campus Serra, and we receive as work an audiovisual production on a theme related to the Espírito Santo. 
We chose the Mariana / Rio Doce disaster because a lot of people don't know the true impact it has had on our lives and they think it's okay.
The video is in progress and as soon as possible we will upload it on that site page.We are very grateful for your patience.
